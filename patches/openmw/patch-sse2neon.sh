# Relax the hard Clang-version guard in extern/maskedoc/sse2neon.h so the
# code compiles with Clang 9 (the version shipped inside NDK r21e).
#
# The guard reads:
#   #error "Clang versions earlier than 11 are not supported."
# and the accompanying comment is "known NEON codegen bugs (issue #622)" —
# not "missing features". Empirically, the SSE2-subset that maskedoc uses
# builds fine on Clang 9. This script just comments out that #error.
#
# Usage: sh patch-sse2neon.sh <arenamw-source-dir>
